    "text": "I am a Bayesian statistician, currently finishing a Ph.D. in statistical science at Duke University under the supervision of Prof. Jason Xu. I successfully defended a thesis titled Exact Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Latent Variable Stochastic Models with Complex, Discrete Structures in June 2024. My research revolves around the development of efficient sampling algorithms for Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation for problems characterized by high-dimensional, complex latent variables. My work has found applications in contagious disease modeling, cancer natural history modeling and vaccines trials.\nI have obtained a Masters in statistical science at Duke University and a double B.S. in Liberal Arts at the University College Maastricht, the Netherlands, and the University College Freiburg, Germany.\nIn parallel to my doctoral research, I have interned at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, since May 2023. I have analyszed event-based trial designs for binary endpoints, and collaborated on the developement of the Julia package MultistateModels that fits semi-Markov multistate models to panel data using the Monte Carlo EM algorithm.\nFinally, I am currently enrolled in the Certificate of College Teaching at Duke University where I taught STA101 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference in 2021 and 2022. I have also mentored J. Huang (Major in statistical science and computer science) and M. Chen (Masters in statistical science)."

    "text": "As an instructor, I see my role as taking students to the next step of their statistical education, whether it is an intermediate course, an undergraduate thesis, graduate studies in statistics or a statistics-related field, or simply become everyday critical consumers of statistical analyses. The two principles that guide my teaching philosophy are (1) to let students play an integral role in their statistical education, and (2) to have students focus on learning statistics (rather than maximizing their grades).\nMy teaching of STA101 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference at Duke University in 2021 and 2022 illustrates this role and these two principles. Students enrolled in this course typically come from other departments and take the class as an elective. Often, this is the only class in the field of statistics that they will ever take. My overarching goal was therefore for students to become critical consumers of statistical analyses. A concrete step that I took towards this goal was to replace the traditional midterm exam by a data analysis project. This forecasting midterm project, together with a second, open-ended, inferential project at the end of the course, let students gain direct experience with data analysis, and acquire the skills to recognize a sound and rigorous statistical analysis from a bogus one. In addition, to implement the first principle, I regularly gauge the students’ attitude towards the course both informally through 1-minute micro-essays (“If any, what concept covered in the course do you not fully understand yet?”, “What topic would like to learn more about?”, etc) and formally through an anonymous midterm course evaluation in which I specifically ask for feedback on suggestion on the lectures, assignments, etc. Finally, the second principle guides the entire structure of the course, from the design of the lecture to the type of assinbments. I superseded lectures with in-class activities; in fact, I rarely talk for more than 15 minutes without having such activity. They usually consist in multiple choice and open-ended questions or in simple coding exercises and are done in groups or individually depending on what is most appropriate. Moreover, to help students spend less time looking for lecture notes or the rubric for the projects, I designed a user-friendly course website playing the role of a one-stop shop with all the course material. Having all the course material in a single place helps students find any information they need quickly and seamlessly.\nTo continuously develop my teaching skills, I have enrolled in the Certificate in College Teaching at Duke University, participated in the 2022 summer course design workshop at Duke University and took the course STA772 Mentoring Undergraduate STEM Research at the Department of Statistical Science, Duke University in Fall 2021."
