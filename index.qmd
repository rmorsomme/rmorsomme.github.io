I am a Bayesian statistician and work at the U.S. Food & Drug Administration as a statistical reviewer.

I recently completed a Ph.D. in statistical science at Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/). My doctoral research revolved around the development of efficient sampling algorithms for Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation for problems characterized by high-dimensional, complex latent variables. My work has found applications in contagious disease modeling, cancer natural history modeling and vaccine trials.

During my Ph.D., I spent 15 months at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, as a visiting researcher. I studied event-based trial designs for binary endpoints, and collaborated on the development of the `Julia` package `MultistateModels` that fits semi-Markov multistate models to panel data using the Monte Carlo EM algorithm.

I have obtained a Masters in statistical science at Duke University and a double B.S. in Liberal Arts at the University College Maastricht, the Netherlands, and the University College Freiburg, Germany. I have also obtained the Certificate of College Teaching at Duke University where I taught [STA101 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/) in 2021 and 2022 and mentored J. Huang (Major in statistical science and computer science) and M. Chen (Masters in statistical science).
