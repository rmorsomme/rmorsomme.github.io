I am a Bayesian statistician, currently a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at Duke University under the supervision of Dr. Jason Xu. I develop efficient **Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms** for problems characterized by **high-dimensional missing data** with applications in epidemiology and medicine.

When not creating new MCMC samplers, I enjoy playing tennis, model making and cooking. I am also a fan of Formula 1.
