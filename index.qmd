I am a Bayesian statistician, currently finishing a Ph.D. in statistical science at Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/). I successfully defended a thesis titled **Exact Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Latent Variable Stochastic Models with Complex, Discrete Structures** in June 2024. My research revolves around the development of efficient sampling algorithms for Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation for problems characterized by high-dimensional, complex latent variables. My work has found applications in contagious disease modeling, cancer natural history modeling and vaccines trials.

I have obtained a Masters in statistical science at Duke University and a double B.S. in Liberal Arts at the University College Maastricht, the Netherlands, and the University College Freiburg, Germany.

In parallel to my doctoral research, I have interned at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, since May 2023. I have analyszed event-based trial designs for binary endpoints, and collaborated on the developement of the `Julia` package `MultistateModels` that fits semi-Markov multistate models to panel data using the Monte Carlo EM algorithm.

Finally, I am currently enrolled in the Certificate of College Teaching at Duke University where I taught [STA101 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://rmorsomme.github.io/website/) in 2021 and 2022. I have also mentored J. Huang (Major in statistical science and computer science) and M. Chen (Masters in statistical science).
