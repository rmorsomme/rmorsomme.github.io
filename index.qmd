I am a Bayesian statistician, currently a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at Duke University under the supervision of Dr. Jason Xu. I develop efficient **Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms** for problems characterized by **high-dimensional missing data** with applications in epidemiology and medicine.

I taught STA101 Data Analysis and Statistical Inference in Summer 2021 and Summer 2022 and am also mentoring Jenny Huang, an undergraduate student in statistics.

When not designing new MCMC samplers, I enjoy playing tennis, model making and cooking. I am also a fan of Formula 1.
